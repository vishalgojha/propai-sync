# Gateway troubleshooting

This page is the deep runbook.
Start at [/help/troubleshooting](/help/troubleshooting) if you want the fast triage flow first.

## Command ladder

Run these first, in this order:

```bash
propai status
propai gateway status
propai logs --follow
propai doctor
propai channels status --probe
```

Expected healthy signals:

- `propai gateway status` shows `Runtime: running` and `RPC probe: ok`.
- `propai doctor` reports no blocking config/service issues.
- `propai channels status --probe` shows connected/ready channels.

## Anthropic 429 extra usage required for long context

Use this when logs/errors include:
`HTTP 429: rate_limit_error: Extra usage is required for long context requests`.

```bash
propai logs --follow
propai models status
propai config get agents.defaults.models
```

Look for:

- Selected Anthropic Opus/Sonnet model has `params.context1m: true`.
- Current Anthropic credential is not eligible for long-context usage.
- Requests fail only on long sessions/model runs that need the 1M beta path.

Fix options:

1. Disable `context1m` for that model to fall back to the normal context window.
2. Use an Anthropic API key with billing, or enable Anthropic Extra Usage on the subscription account.
3. Configure fallback models so runs continue when Anthropic long-context requests are rejected.

## No replies

If channels are up but nothing answers, check routing and policy before reconnecting anything.

```bash
propai status
propai channels status --probe
propai pairing list --channel <channel> [--account <id>]
propai config get channels
propai logs --follow
```

Look for:

- Pairing pending for DM senders.
- Group mention gating (`requireMention`, `mentionPatterns`).
- Channel/group allowlist mismatches.

Common signatures:

- `drop guild message (mention required` → group message ignored until mention.
- `pairing request` → sender needs approval.
- `blocked` / `allowlist` → sender/channel was filtered by policy.

## Dashboard control ui connectivity

When dashboard/control UI will not connect, validate URL, auth mode, and secure context assumptions.

```bash
propai gateway status
propai status
propai logs --follow
propai doctor
propai gateway status --json
```

Look for:

- Correct probe URL and dashboard URL.
- Auth mode/token mismatch between client and gateway.
- HTTP usage where device identity is required.

Common signatures:

- `device identity required` → non-secure context or missing device auth.
- `device nonce required` / `device nonce mismatch` → client is not completing the
  challenge-based device auth flow (`connect.challenge` + `device.nonce`).
- `device signature invalid` / `device signature expired` → client signed the wrong
  payload (or stale timestamp) for the current handshake.
- `AUTH_TOKEN_MISMATCH` with `canRetryWithDeviceToken=true` → client can do one trusted retry with cached device token.
- repeated `unauthorized` after that retry → shared token/device token drift; refresh token config and re-approve/rotate device token if needed.
- `gateway connect failed:` → wrong host/port/url target.

### Auth detail codes quick map

Use `error.details.code` from the failed `connect` response to pick the next action:

| Detail code                  | Meaning                                                  | Recommended action                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AUTH_TOKEN_MISSING`         | Client did not send a required shared token.             | Paste/set token in the client and retry. For dashboard paths: `propai config get gateway.auth.token` then paste into Control UI settings.                          |
| `AUTH_TOKEN_MISMATCH`        | Shared token did not match gateway auth token.           | If `canRetryWithDeviceToken=true`, allow one trusted retry. If still failing, run the [token drift recovery checklist](/cli/devices#token-drift-recovery-checklist). |
| `AUTH_DEVICE_TOKEN_MISMATCH` | Cached per-device token is stale or revoked.             | Rotate/re-approve device token using [devices CLI](/cli/devices), then reconnect.                                                                                    |
| `PAIRING_REQUIRED`           | Device identity is known but not approved for this role. | Approve pending request: `propai devices list` then `propai devices approve <requestId>`.                                                                        |

Device auth v2 migration check:

```bash
propai --version
propai doctor
propai gateway status
```

If logs show nonce/signature errors, update the connecting client and verify it:

1. waits for `connect.challenge`
2. signs the challenge-bound payload
3. sends `connect.params.device.nonce` with the same challenge nonce

## Gateway service not running

Use this when service is installed but process does not stay up.

```bash
propai gateway status
propai status
propai logs --follow
propai doctor
propai gateway status --deep
```

Look for:

- `Runtime: stopped` with exit hints.
- Service config mismatch (`Config (cli)` vs `Config (service)`).
- Port/listener conflicts.

Common signatures:

- `Gateway start blocked: set gateway.mode=local` → local gateway mode is not enabled. Fix: set `gateway.mode="local"` in your config (or run `propai configure`). If you are running propai via Podman using the dedicated `propai` user, the config lives at `~propai/.propai/propai.json`.
- `refusing to bind gateway ... without auth` → non-loopback bind without token/password.
- `another gateway instance is already listening` / `EADDRINUSE` → port conflict.

## Channel connected messages not flowing

If channel state is connected but message flow is dead, focus on policy, permissions, and channel specific delivery rules.

```bash
propai channels status --probe
propai pairing list --channel <channel> [--account <id>]
propai status --deep
propai logs --follow
propai config get channels
```

Look for:

- DM policy (`pairing`, `allowlist`, `open`, `disabled`).
- Group allowlist and mention requirements.
- Missing channel API permissions/scopes.

Common signatures:

- `mention required` → message ignored by group mention policy.
- `pairing` / pending approval traces → sender is not approved.
- `missing_scope`, `not_in_channel`, `Forbidden`, `401/403` → channel auth/permissions issue.

## Cron and heartbeat delivery

If cron or heartbeat did not run or did not deliver, verify scheduler state first, then delivery target.

```bash
propai cron status
propai cron list
propai cron runs --id <jobId> --limit 20
propai system heartbeat last
propai logs --follow
```

Look for:

- Cron enabled and next wake present.
- Job run history status (`ok`, `skipped`, `error`).
- Heartbeat skip reasons (`quiet-hours`, `requests-in-flight`, `alerts-disabled`).

Common signatures:

- `cron: scheduler disabled; jobs will not run automatically` → cron disabled.
- `cron: timer tick failed` → scheduler tick failed; check file/log/runtime errors.
- `heartbeat skipped` with `reason=quiet-hours` → outside active hours window.
- `heartbeat: unknown accountId` → invalid account id for heartbeat delivery target.
- `heartbeat skipped` with `reason=dm-blocked` → heartbeat target resolved to a DM-style destination while `agents.defaults.heartbeat.directPolicy` (or per-agent override) is set to `block`.

## Node paired tool fails

If a node is paired but tools fail, isolate foreground, permission, and approval state.

```bash
propai nodes status
propai nodes describe --node <idOrNameOrIp>
propai approvals get --node <idOrNameOrIp>
propai logs --follow
propai status
```

Look for:

- Node online with expected capabilities.
- OS permission grants for camera/mic/location/screen.
- Exec approvals and allowlist state.

Common signatures:

- `NODE_BACKGROUND_UNAVAILABLE` → node app must be in foreground.
- `*_PERMISSION_REQUIRED` / `LOCATION_PERMISSION_REQUIRED` → missing OS permission.
- `SYSTEM_RUN_DENIED: approval required` → exec approval pending.
- `SYSTEM_RUN_DENIED: allowlist miss` → command blocked by allowlist.

## Browser tool fails

Use this when browser tool actions fail even though the gateway itself is healthy.

```bash
propai browser status
propai browser start --browser-profile propai
propai browser profiles
propai logs --follow
propai doctor
```

Look for:

- Valid browser executable path.
- CDP profile reachability.
- Extension relay tab attachment for `profile="chrome"`.

Common signatures:

- `Failed to start Chrome CDP on port` → browser process failed to launch.
- `browser.executablePath not found` → configured path is invalid.
- `Chrome extension relay is running, but no tab is connected` → extension relay not attached.
- `Browser attachOnly is enabled ... not reachable` → attach-only profile has no reachable target.

## If you upgraded and something suddenly broke

Most post-upgrade breakage is config drift or stricter defaults now being enforced.

### 1) Auth and URL override behavior changed

```bash
propai gateway status
propai config get gateway.mode
propai config get gateway.remote.url
propai config get gateway.auth.mode
```

What to check:

- If `gateway.mode=remote`, CLI calls may be targeting remote while your local service is fine.
- Explicit `--url` calls do not fall back to stored credentials.

Common signatures:

- `gateway connect failed:` → wrong URL target.
- `unauthorized` → endpoint reachable but wrong auth.

### 2) Bind and auth guardrails are stricter

```bash
propai config get gateway.bind
propai config get gateway.auth.token
propai gateway status
propai logs --follow
```

What to check:

- Non-loopback binds (`lan`, `tailnet`, `custom`) need auth configured.
- Old keys like `gateway.token` do not replace `gateway.auth.token`.

Common signatures:

- `refusing to bind gateway ... without auth` → bind+auth mismatch.
- `RPC probe: failed` while runtime is running → gateway alive but inaccessible with current auth/url.

### 3) Pairing and device identity state changed

```bash
propai devices list
propai pairing list --channel <channel> [--account <id>]
propai logs --follow
propai doctor
```

What to check:

- Pending device approvals for dashboard/nodes.
- Pending DM pairing approvals after policy or identity changes.

Common signatures:

- `device identity required` → device auth not satisfied.
- `pairing required` → sender/device must be approved.

If the service config and runtime still disagree after checks, reinstall service metadata from the same profile/state directory:

```bash
propai gateway install --force
propai gateway restart
```
